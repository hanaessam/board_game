# Connect 4 AI agent board game
Me and my amazing team (Shahd Taher, Maryem Hesham, Farida Ahmed) recently completed a project for my Artificial Intelligence course at the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University. My teammates and I made a Connect 4 game using Python. We were required to implement the minimax algorithm to drive the intelligent agent's actions, and to improve the minimax algorithm's speed, we implemented alpha-beta pruning.

Of course, we used AI tools to develop the AI agent and simplify our coding process. We relied heavily on GitHub Copilot to save us the time and effort of writing code from scratch.

GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool that can generate code based on natural language descriptions. It can be a huge time saver, especially for repetitive tasks. However, it's important to remember that GitHub Copilot is still under development, and it can sometimes generate incorrect or even harmful code.

Overall, we found that AI tools can be a valuable asset for coding. However, it's important to use them responsibly and to always review the code they generate carefully.

Here are some of the benefits me and the team members noticed during using AI tools in coding:
Speed: AI tools can help you write code faster by generating code suggestions and completing repetitive tasks.
Accuracy: AI tools can help you write more accurate code by catching errors and suggesting improvements.
Creativity: AI tools can help you come up with new ideas and solutions by generating new code patterns and suggesting new algorithms.

Here are some of the risks of using AI tools in coding:
Security: AI tools can generate code that contains security vulnerabilities.
Plagiarism: AI tools can generate code that is plagiarized from other sources.

It's important to weigh the benefits and risks of using AI tools before using them in your coding projects. If you do decide to use AI tools, it's important to use them responsibly and to always review the code they generate carefully.
